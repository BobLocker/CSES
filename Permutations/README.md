### TASK

A permutation of integers 1,2,…,*n* is called beautiful if there are no adjacent elements 
whose difference is 1.

Given *n*, construct a beautiful permutation if such a permutation exists.

**Input**

The only input line contains an integer *n*.

**Output**

Print a beautiful permutation of integers 1,2,…,*n*. If there are several solutions, 
you may print any of them. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

### Example 1:
```
Input:
5
Output:
2 4 1 3 5
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
3
Output:
NO SOLUTION
```

### Constraints:

* `1 <= n <= 10^6`
