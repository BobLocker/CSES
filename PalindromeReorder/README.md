### TASK

Given a string, your task is to reorder its letters in such a way that it becomes 
a palindrome (i.e., it reads the same forwards and backwards).

**Input**

The only input line has a string of length *n* consisting of characters Aâ€“Z.

**Output**

Print a palindrome consisting of the characters of the original string. 
You may print any valid solution. If there are no solutions, print "NO SOLUTION".

### Example 1:
```
Input:
AAAACACBA
Output:
AACABACAA
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
AABBCD
Output:
NO SOLUTION
```

### Constraints:

* `1 <= n <= 10^6`
